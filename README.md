PurdueInMinecraft (Bedrock Edition)

*This file is a port of the PurdueInMinecraft world from Minecraft: Java Edition by estebanrichey to the Minecraft Bedrock platform (Minecraft for Windows 10, Minecraft Pocket Edition, Minecraft for Xbox One, Minecraft for Playstation, and Minecraft for Nintendo Switch. All building credit goes to estebanrichey. Last world conversion: July 21, 2021.*

This is Purdue University, built in Minecraft! This project started in March 2019, my second semester here at Purdue. I built the inside and outside of my campus ministry, Launch Campus Ministry, to scale in Minecraft (located at 507 Waldron Street)
Then I built the parking lots surround the building, and then the apartment complex across the street. Then the fraternities and sororities surrounding us. Then I made Ford dining court, and so on and so forth.
Esteban Richey is the main contributor of this project, approximately 65% of the buildings. Andrew, my roommate, contributed approximately 30% of the buildings (including the Corec, Stewart, and many others!) and my fellow campus ministry friend Zach contributed approximately 5% of the buildings, 3 greek house buildings on the north east corner of Waldron.

Here is a picture of the current map of the build (the floor map is located inside Beering!)
