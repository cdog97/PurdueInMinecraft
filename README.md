PurdueInMinecraft

This is Purdue University, built in Minecraft! This project started in March 2019, my second semester here at Purdue. I built the inside and outside of my campus ministry, Launch Campus Ministry, to scale in Minecraft (located at 507 Waldron Street)
Then I built the parking lots surround the building, and then the apartment complex across the street. Then the fraternities and sororities surrounding us. Then I made Ford dining court, and so on and so forth.
Esteban Richey is the main contributor of this project, approximately 65% of the buildings. Andrew, my roommate, contributed approximately 30% of the buildings (including the Corec, Stewart, and many others!) and my fellow campus ministry friend Zach contributed approximately 5% of the buildings, 3 greek house buildings on the north east corner of Waldron.

Here is a picture of the current map of the build (the floor map is located inside Beering!)
